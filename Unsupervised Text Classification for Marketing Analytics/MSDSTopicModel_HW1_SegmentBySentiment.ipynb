Also, the button that turns on the button pressing sound always gets hit by my coat sleeve, which is pretty annoying. I would have given it a 5/5 if it weren't for these couple things.\", 'This watch is advertised as being able to withstand the rigours of being worn by an active child.However it very quickly became extremely scratched and the strap faded out badly.  The strap also broke which made it impossible to wear.All of this transpired in the first 6 months.The watch itself goes well.', \"PROS:-Good looking watch.-Fairly easy to use.-Love the fact that the watch face is twisted to make viewing it while I run easier.-The watch's wrist band held up well, unlike the Swiss Army watches I've had crack on me.CONS:-After only a month's use, the plasic wrap that encases the watch itself started to detach and warp.  It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch.  It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside.  From diving deeper than its 100M rating, you ask?  No, from sweat and shower water.  The digital display is now failing and I'll soon have to throw the watch away like a piece of trash.  That's just unnaceptable, Nike.\", \"My son requested this watch specifically for Christmas. He is a marathon runner and had lost his heart monitor watch (oddly enough, I'm not sure this watch has a heart monitor although it seems to have everything else a runner could want). The watch was not easy to find based on model number, even on the Nike website. I actually had to call Nike to help find the right search words/model numbers to look for. By then, I had to pay extra for delivery in order to be guaranteed to get it by Dec. 24.  It ended up arriving at least 2 days early, brand new in the box. My son loves it.\", 'I wear it daily.  the buttons depress accidentally though so it does not stay on the \"time\" screen.', \"I purchased this watch on 8/6/08.  I am currently in Iraq and I needed a backup. I already own one similar to this one. I just wanted one on standby in case my battery died or another mishap. This watch that I purchased on Amazon died on 9/7/08.  It doesn't work at all. I don't know what happened.  I only wore it 2-3 times because my other watch still worked.  Watches are supposed to last longer than 30 days and this one didn't.  I'm not sure if its because I didn't buy it directly through NIKE or because I took the short cut.  Nevertheless, I'm still out of $40+ and I don't have anything but a worthless watch to show for.  I don't recommend this product.\", 'Problem #1The design stinks. It is impossible to move your hand without putting the watch into a reset mode, and loosing all of your settings.Problem #2The watch I got broke 8 hours into use.Problem #3The customer service on this watch is horrible. The company my watch was purchased from (This was not Amazon itself, but through Amazon to the company named WatchZone) was the worst I have ever seen.Here is WatchZone\\'s return policy: (No Joke, word for word)Quote--\"The watch can only be returned if it has NEVER been worn. It is impossible to wear a watch (even for short periods) and not get it scratched or blemished.\"Any trouble with the watch and WatchZone passes the buck to the manufacturer.NikeTiming also has a terrible customer service. Upon calling, you cannot actually contact anybody. When they ask for your number so they can contact you back, they don\\'t. Finally, they make you pay for shipping, re-stalking, and other such fees when they are the ones who sent you defective merchandise in the first place.Grand total: The watch that I got was on sale for $20 off. It is taking me more than $30 to get a working one (if they send me a functional one THIS time.)I would advise anybody who is looking for a watch to steer clear of NikeTiming and WatchZone. You will get a better product if you just buy the $20 Wall-Mart special, and you will be spending less even if you donate $40 to FedEx.', 'I bought this watch for my son, who is almost 12. It is nearly impossible to set it...the instructions are VERY difficult to understand, and virtually worthless.

I live at 5005 feet in elivation and have to set the watch at least once a day to keep it accurate.  The temperature function is always off.  The compas seems to work well.  All of this is nothing compared to the time when it became necessary to replace the battery (less than one year with both watches).  I didn't have the necessary special tools to replace the battery.  Replacing the battery was a major accomplishment. I could not get the first watch to work after replacing the battery. The second watch quit working when the factory battery failed and I finally threw it away, as I had done with the first one.  If you want to buy a watch that will work for the life of the factory battery only, this is the one for you.\", \"Received watch, removed from packing and found out that the watch didn't work.  Seller told me to return and a replacement would be sent.  Setter received and told me it would take a week or longer to mail replacement.

They did!End of story  I purchased a Timex from Fred Meyer\", \"I've had a Lance 4 since they first hit the market. I will admit that I don't use all the function(seriously, who needs all those alarms?). The altimeter is pretty useless, as it's inaccurate AND you need to enter the exact elevation of your starting location for the watch to be useful. Who really knows the elevation of their home?The case, even though it's titanium, is terribly fragile. I had mine for six weeks, worn as a normal watch(at my inside job), and the case was scratched and dinged as if it was 10 years old. Nike replaced the case for me after 6 months, at which time I needed a new battery. Battery life is horrible on this thing. Expect to spend 20 bucks a year sending it back for replacement.I forgot to mention som4ething. When I sent the watch back after having it for six months, the band had broken. The rubber tore where it attached to the case---and that was simply from taking the watch off. No bike crashes, no playing sports. Just removing it. At that time, the yellow in the engraved Lance Armstrong signature on the case back had also come off. As a matter of fact, it actually stuck to my wrist. Not a huge deal, but pretty poor build quality. I have a Lance Race watch which is my daily wear watch. I put the Lance 4 on ONLY when I'm riding my bike. It's delicate.\", \"Received watch and it would never sync. Watch completely stopped working. I returned the watch to amazon by priority mail, and for some reason they seem to can't find the package.  I'm still waiting for them to return my $195.00 to my account.

Yes it may be less expensive, but just pay for it from the nike store and get better service.\", 'I originally purchased this watch well over two years ago, but through an unfortunate accident broke it.  The break was in no way indicative of he quality of the watch, but the result of freakishly bad luck.  Regardless,  I have spent the last two plus years trying to replace it, & find its equal.

I've used this solely for running.-Simple operation after the initial setup(put on heartrate monitor and go)-The cloth part of the chest band is washable-There is no metal that touches your skin so it doesn't make you cold on cold mornings-Lot of display options-Very easy to read screen-Lot of useful features (including interval timing, time in target Heart Rate zone, etc.)-You can have the option of setting a power save so the watch 'sleeps' if it isn't used for a certain number of hours.\", 'Product.not reliable.battery went flat after 6 months.

Given that the electronics in this thing must weigh nothing, it's obvious that Nike has packed the case with redundant chunks of metal to make it so heavy. Just wearing it for a day gives your arm a workout! However, if you're in the market for an eye-catching big digital watch that has a clear display with large numerals that shows all the basic information (time, seconds, date), that's fairly affordable then this might be the one for you.If you want a similar watch that's not so big, check out the Nike Blade watch - the styling is less dramatic, but it won't break your wrist to the same degree.\", \"Very disappointed about this product. I've had it just few months and the metal around the front came off and I've not even exposed the watch to water or anything, even though it's supposed to be water resistant. You can tell that the metal was not glued properly to begin with.

My main complaint, is that the buttons are really sensitive.  Half the time I look at my watch it says 4:00 AM (which is the time I have my alarm set to).  The Orange button on the front is what toggles this, so anything that touches it switches to the alarm mode.  This has become really annoying', \"I got this for my birthday and a little over a year later it was useless.  The plastic/rubber watch strap just corroded away and broke off.  I went to the Nike Store to get a new strap and they said try a sporting goods store.  Went to a couple and couldn't find any place that sold replacement straps.  I searched the internet high and low and eventually found Parsec Ent.  They sent me a strap for $23.95 (rip off) only to find out that it is impossible to replace the strap.

Weird, I know. That's especially annoying when you have a bunch of times stored in the watch's data feature (its most appealing feature).If you're putting on or taking off a shirt, the static electricity will shock the watch and you will hear the watch beep.

I'm not sure if other watches do this, but for some reason that annoyed me.\", 'I love this design and the features were what I needed.  Too bad the band fell apart from the watch body within a few months.  I mailed it back to NIKE and they just put it back in another envelope and mailed it back to me.

The band broke, and because of the way that the band is part of the watch, it cannot be replaced.  There was no sudden strike that caused the break.  It just basically wore out.

You can tell the time from almost any crazy angle and the print on the watch is very large.  The band has a very weird, unique design in that it buckles off-center, which seems to work very well for this watch.  Though the metal clip to hold the band down is annoying while typing.  It has a 100-track record which is more than enough for me and the data even allows you to modify results with distances for record tracking.This watch is near perfection.  There was only one thing wrong...Every time I bend my wrist, it hits the \"mode\" button.  This means every time I look at my watch I am in Chronology or Counter mode.

Wasted money:-( Don't waste your money on these.\", 'Unfortunately the shoes you receive will not be the ones in the picture (brown and tan). The shoes are bright pink, yellow, white, black and blue....not even close to the neutral colors displayed. I sent an e-mail to Backcountry and never got any response. I think they are terribly ugly but my son was tired of waiting for new shoes so he wore them anyway.Disappointed Mother', 'Received Nike Fury 100 Style Watch for Christmas...,I have never used it due to instructions are not in English.I am trying to locate instructions.  Please help..Rated one starbecause I can not use it without the proper instructions.', \"I'm disappointed Nike is getting out of the timing business as the angled face works great for paddling.  Hope some manufacturer picks up on it.  This Nike replaces another that failed after a long hard life.\", 'The watch has the basic functions needed and appears to be very durable (but heavy).  I run at night; so I am disappointed that the watch does not have an option to automatically turn on the light when a button is pressed.', \"My watch broke within two months of purchase. I'm sending it back to be repaired, but I'd rather get my money back. I don't think the features are very well designed. For example, to set the countdown timer to a new value, you have reset the current timer to its initial value - you can't just stop a timer in the middle and set a new value. It might not seem like a big deal, but little things like that can be annoying. The hourly beep turns on and off sometimes when I bend my wrist. I think I'll be going back to the Timex Ironman.\", 'I bought this watch and I am very much satisfied with this product. But I am disappointed that amazon fluctuates price of same product so frequently that I bought it twice with a gap of 10 days and difference was 10% in price', 'I did a search for Heart Monitor and this item appeared, and being a fan of Nike, I just ordered the item not researching farther.  When I received it I realized that this watch did not have the Heart Monitor feature.  I immediately returned it.  FYI....This watch has a really small wrist band.  Not sure why this watch appeared in my search.', 'The setup process is a little bit complicated.  But after that, it works very well.', 'I wish I could give no starts. Looked cheap, uncomfortable on hand.  Came in plastic zipper bag, no box. I did return this monstrosity (I had to pay s+h)', \"This watch is made for right-handed people.  4 of the past 7 presidents have been left-handed.  Can't we get watches?\", \"The add did originally not tell me it was a women's watch!The watch is probably fine, but a bit small for my wrist, thank you.\", 'I was seriously embarrassed when my brother opened his Christmas gift and this is what he saw. It is very cheap looking and I was not happy with it at all once I saw it in person.', 'Got this t-shirt to start using it when i go to the gym, i hope to not get a wrong size', 'The service I have received since receiving my product has been awful. Not only is the product faulty and not working but the company who sent it are no where to be found!! I have been calling them for over three weeks on three seperate numbers plus an email address and I have had no reply. I have contacted Nike direct about this but if I send it back to them I have to forfit the postage cost and maybe other costs. I have since managed to get hold of the company Jamashop/Watchsavers who where far from helpful and have directed me again to their website with details on how to send it back but I am very torn on trusting this company. I was very worried about ordering off the internet and after this experaince I will not be doing it again.', 'I bought this for my daughter. She had viewed the picture and thought the band was a clamp type. She said that the strap hurt her wrist. Also, when we tried to set it following the diagram, we managed to set the time, but none of the rest - date, stopwatch, etc. The options flashed by without allowing us to change them. It may have been one defective watch, but it was hard to tell if it was that or that we interpreted the pictures incorrectly. I returned the watch.', 'The watch is fine; and why wouldn\\'t it be? But it was nearly impossible to get TO it. It comes enclosed in a hard, black \" sphere \" that was supposed to be slightly open; thus enabling one to remove the watch from it. However, mine was sealed shut and no amount of pulling and pushing and twisting let me open it. I had no recourse but to trek to the Nike store and ask them to do it. Well, they did -- but only after about 1/2 an hour of killing themselves as well. My recommendation? Buy the watch in a store and let them hand it to you.', \"Nike Women's Triax Swift Analog Watch #WR0078-401I ordered it  as a birthday gift. It was nicly packed but defective - did not work at all. Big disappointment.\", 'I bought this watch one year ago. I could wear it just for 6 months, then it came off. I hated its rubbery band design. When you put the watch on a desk, it seems like U-shape. It never gets flatten, so bands are damaged and cracked easily. Rubbery bands glued to the case of the watch. My watch was broken apart from that glued part. I recommend you to buy a leather or a stainless steel watch instead of paying $70 for this useless watch.', 'Actully wheh I order the Nike Air structure triax 91 ,I inteded to give to a friend as a gift but when i received it i shocked it was a very cheap quality and very bad made so I keep it in store with regret .', 'Even though they were a bit small they were not comfortable shoes. I was disappointed with these. Nike is hit or miss sometimes', 'The shoes were not as I expected the inner sole of the shoe are hard as rock and very uncomfortable and the shoes were too big.', 'the shoe feels like a fake nike shoe. theres too much padding inside the shoe and feels really wide. my husband disliked these shoes alot. they gave him blisters on his feet first day he wore them.', 'When I got the shoes they where very narrow and hurt my feet. After some breakin time they got better but still are very hard and not what I want to do alot of walking in.', \"I am a man of medium build, who typically buys watches in the 40-42mm range.  This watch is SMALL - very small.  It is 42mm across diagonally, but it is much smaller in the other direction because it has a rectangular shape - so it appears much smaller than just simply saying it's 42mm.  There's another nike fury listed as ladies that is 45mm - that should tell you something.  The worst part is the band size.  I have NEVER seen a band this small on a mens watch.  I compared and it is the size of the bands on my wife's dress watches - that's how tiny it is.  Of the 14 holes in the band, I have to set it to the 13th hole for it to fit comfortably!  I will ask my wife if she wants it (because it is a cool looking), otherwise it will go back.Trust me, if you are a guy DO NOT BUY this watch unless you are tiny or like small, ladies size watches.\", 'The clock face is rotated to facilitate viewing when worn on the left wrist. Many left handed people wear their watch on the right wrist however. The watch face is rotated the wrong direction to be worn on the right wrist however. There is no right wrist version for left handed individuals. Big fail by Nike.', 'have to say I am very disappointed in this set of shoes, got some back in 2001 and have worn them to death, but this bunch runs small and if you size up the shoe get to be too wide. and the seller shoopop is a JOKE still waiting in my two refunds and the ZON wont reinforce their own policies', 'Shoe size runs small, order .5 size bigger. too tight.', 'I am totally disappointed.  It is difficult to read in sunlight (I run in the park and can only read it in shadows).  It does not operate correctly with iPod as advertised.  STAY AWAY.  I ended up buying a polar unit which has a much better tracking application.', \"This is the second time we've given this watch a try.  Both times it has lasted less than a year.  Would not recommend this watch.\", 'I bought this watch for work because it is digital and no metal on it.  I really loved wearing it and it is so cute.  However after only having it a few months it died.  I thought it was the battery and searched all over for the battery it took but that did not work either.  Very disappointed that a Nike watch would die, especially one so expensive.  I would love to buy another but hate to spend the money just to have it die in less that a year.  Maybe I got a lemon I am not sure.', 'The watch is really cute but because of the odd orientation it cuts into your wrist a little and is actually hard to read.', 'I ordered this shoe and received a Nike Free 5 that looks nothing like this shoe..very disappointed, now this shoe is not available.', \"This review is late, but I bought these for my husband last year. He loves them. He doesn't use them much where we are, but for those few cold weeks, he goes straight to these boots for winter footwear.\", \"I paid Amazon $171.47 for an order of one pair of ACG Nike boots.  Prior to ordering the boots, I visited the Nike web site and obtained their precise instructions to measure one's feet to determine what size to order.  The order was delivered on May 15, 2014.  I tried the boots on the next day and was very disappointed they were much too small.  I immediately sent then back for a refund.  The boots were received by the seller on 5/19 as indicated on my UPS tracking number.  Unfortunately, the seller is only refunding $154.97.  With the $10.18 I spent on shipping to return the boots, it is costing me a total of $26.66 to try on a pair of boots.  If these were in fact authentic Nike product I cannot believe there would be such a disconnect between the Nike Web Site and the seller of this product.  Last time I will ever buy shoes from Amazon.  A shoe store charges me nothing to simply try on a pair of shoes; Amazon charges $26.68.  In addition, I have assurances at a store the product is authentic since authorized retail locations are listed on the Nike site.\", 'Hella heavy. If you dont wear thick long socks then the upper heal near the calf rubs against the shoe causing blisters.  Also, the plastic lace holes breaks apart from the leather after a month of use.POS shoe.', \"Was excited to finally find a size 13 shoe in white for my son. Was very disappointed when the shoe arrived and he couldn't get his foot in the shoe. Because I can't actually use what I purchased, I have to give it two stars since I don't like the fact the shoes run this small.\", 'I ordered the same size I have worn for the last at least 10 years of my life and this shoe was too big.  I then had to pay almost $13.00 to ship back.  Ridiculous!!!!!', 'Very flat on the bottoms, little if any arch support inside.  My son walks around in them as if he were wearing  cardboard boxes. If I could select the shoes that my 10 year old would wear, it would not be these.  However since a boy likes what a boy likes, I guess they will do, until they like all other Nike sneakers fall apart in the end.', \"I was very disappointed when I opened the package: the sunglasses are ok, but there is no case with it, only a pouch, maybe they call it a case...The box (paper) looks very old, seems like second-handed. What's more, the user's manual inside is old, too. I must return it because it looks so old and cannot be a gift to my friend. I saw other people gave this seller good comments, and I don't want to give a bad one, but it is so different from the description: new, made in Italy, with case...The frame is made in China and the lenses are made in Italy. They should specify this in the description, and nobody will care, but if they say this is made in Italy, I would assume the whole thing is made in Italy. Overall, disappointed. But if the box were not that broken, I would keep it.\", 'Just a little small probably should have gotten a bigger size but they are still so comfy. I wear them all the time', 'Put these 13&#34; sandals up again my other 13&#34; sandals and these are over half inch shorter than my other Nikes.', \"The  problem I have with men's Nike comfort slide 2 sandals , it keeps sliding on one side as I walk. If I had to run for my life with this sandals, I would be in big trouble .\", 'These sandals provide comfort and style if you are the athletic type and for an affordable price as well. I extremely recommend these sandals.', \"Pros: They are comfortable.Cons: They look too big on the feet - when looking down.The Velcro isn't very strong.  Sometimes I take a step and am suddenly without a sandal.Thus, due to unreliable Velcro and rather bulky look, I never wear these out casually.  They are simply my kicking around the house and patio sandal.\", 'My husband loved these.  While other reviews mentioned they ran small I think what they really mean is narrow.  The 15 worked well for my hubs who typically wears a 14W.  Loved them just as much as the Under Armour sandals that are impossible to find.', 'I have these slippers since last Nov. Hardly wore them. Tried wearing them several times, but the adjustable instep strap scraped my skin, causing the skin to break. They are non-usable. Can I return them for credit and get something else. Thank tou, Merrill Krieger', 'I did nopt like the way they mde my feet look like duck feet. The white color isjust wrong. I retured them for another pair of black that I love.', 'the design of the inner sole is terrible.  my feet quickly slipped off to the side after only a few steps so i returned them.would i purchase again?  NOdo i recommend?  NO', \"I tended to go barefoot, especially at home (I live in Hawaii) but when I developed Plantar fasciitis (bottom of foot hurts) my podiatrist said no more barefooting. My son had a pair of Nike Comfort Slides and I tried them on and they helped stop the pain. I bought these to wear and now I have no more pain and can't stand to be barefoot.\", 'bigger than expected', 'i thought that the cushion would be soft like the ones on the girl slippers.... it was hard as a rock and has a weird feeling to it... but since i spent that much money on it my husband decided to keep wearing it until it will break...', 'Way to small I hat it from the beginning, the description in the website is for shoes not a back pack', \"Definitely does not look like something valued at $310.00. What is listed is basketball shoes. A dude is in the picture, and the title says basketball shoes . Asks size and all. Briefly mentions a bag. When you flip to the other ad that is attached you see Niki air Jordans....Nice ones. They sent me a backpack instead of shoes saying they didn't have them. This bag has nothing to do with basketball. It's for running and Nike, of course.\", \"I have owned this Nike Blade watch model WC0037 for 7 months. It is a very neat watch. Unfortunately it broke and I don't know how. One evening I remove it from my wrist and notice the black bubber wrist band had separated from the body at the rear battery cover. The entire rubber/plastic hinge had cracked. This wrist band is not replaceable. I wore this watch daily to my office job. A sports watch should be made rugged. This one is not. Lesson learned is to buy a watch which has a standard replacable wrist band.\", 'The shoes were smaller than normal. I wear a 10.5  and theses felt like they were a size 10. I recommed that if someone orders these they want to order 1 half size bigger.', \"I ordered 9.5 but I received 9 !! I am not happy !! And I don't have time to deal with this situation bcz I am working !! That's why I buy online !!\"]\n"
