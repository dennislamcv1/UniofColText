Leach", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I have a similar model Nike sandal that I purchased about 10 years ago that has nearly worn out after heavy use. I was very satisfied with that sandal and wanted to purchase a similar Nike sandal. First of all after opening the box and trying on these sandals I discovered that this sandal is at least 1/2-1 size small, i.e. I ordered a mens' size 11, my actual foot size is exactly 10.5, and this sandal just barely fits with no exposed edge left whatsoever in the entire sandal (and I'm close to my ideal body weight, not overweight at all). Next it's made of a comparatively thinner polymer material that provides minimal cushioning to absorb shocks. My older sandal had a much thicker sole with a thick tread pattern for non-slip walking, and had a form fitted arch so that my foot neatly fitted into it without slipping when walking, etc. This sandal has none of those good design properties: its sole is much thinner in comparison with minimal arch support; and the tread pattern is comprised of relatively small ridges that do not appear to be thick enough to prevent slipping on wet hard surfaces.Also as another reviewer mentioned the underside of the front support is a fabric-like material that absorbs moisture like crazy so no wonder he said they smelled \"funky\" after a short time..this material if it stays wet is expected to be subject to mold growth.Btm line: save your $ and don't buy this sandal, especially if you've owned similar older Nike sandals. I'm keeping these but will only use them at the gym in the locker shower room which is the intended purpose, but what a disappointment!

It says they can be used for taking a shower in the description, but I wouldn't recommend doing so because of the foam.  I just wear them around the house and they are comfortable.

There was one little flaw. instead of tossing the pair nike finds somewhere to sell it besides one of there stores such as this amazon seller. The shoes fit fine there are no flaws to prove that they are replicas (fakes) but there is a clear flaw that is just a factory mistake by nike. I would post a picture if i could and you would see what i mean. When the shoes are on your feet and you look down at them right where the tip of the nike swoosh is (side closest to the toe of the shoe) there is a kind of curve in the charcol part that follows the curv. on one shoe the curv is perfect and pointed at the end like the nike swoosh but on the other shoe it is rounded and dosent have that same point. it is just a clear poor mistake by nike because if they were replicas these would be the best replicas ever made. Besides that they are some cool kicks but i wouldnt pay the full price for them if they are B grades. I would suggest buying them elsewhere. I am the only one who notices it but i feel like i was cheated of some of the money i spent on them. there very comfortable and i will still wear them till they wear out. you could still buy them but fully inspect the shoe before wearing them because once u wear them u are stuck with them they can not be refunded.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fine but one flaw!! read this before purchase IMPORTANT!", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2013"}

I plan on using them for everyday and gym work such as treadmill and squats.  They are cushy how I like for squats.  The thing I don't like it that the tongue is nylon.  I hate the Cortez nylons as they are cheesy and prefer my shoes to be leather as they last longer look better and are more comfy better made.  Nylon is just a cheap material so I avoid it as much as possible as a rule.  Nike made these Cortez cheaper than their other Cortez.  Cortez is like a tough shoe like Lugz.  Now Nike makes weird shoes with silly colors so harder to get a decent shoe out of them.  I have been looking for the Cortez blue suedes for a long time like four years and have not been able to find them, only the leathers and nylons and this one is a cross of both so that is disappointing.  I wanted to put fat laces on these but with the cheapo nylon inside that seems silly.  Who puts fat laces on nylons?  I probably will but leather tongue is more comfortable plus I plan on running a lot on these and leather is not as absorbent as nylon.  The nylon is going to get funky quick with my demanding workouts.  I guess I'm better off with track Asics and Adidas as it seems Nike is lowering their quality putting brand recognition over quality materials and construction.  Nike leather is cheap and thin and then they try to piece pleather of fabric in places to be even cheaper.  They are too greedy and as a result they are hurting their brand.  I bought four other shoes and I am sure they are all better than this one such as the PUMA Men's Roma Basic Lace-Up Fashion Sneaker.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "could be better", "unixReviewTime": 1373587200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2013"}

The Nike air max 2013, these shoes are the running shoes you see everybody wearing. Ads call them the new hot swagger if super stars got them why don't you. So many people fall for these Ads, but me ii think this product has a problem with it time span, all the different color, there's so many more problem with the shoe. The product has some good qualities but the shoe its self is just ugly for the price there sold for in all stores. These shoes are over priced at $200 a pair. This is my negative review about this product \"THE PRICE\".The prices for the Nike air max 2013 I think are overpriced. Why they cost so much is because of the product description, the Nike air max 2013 running shoes are the most flexible of its kind. People say when they go running the shoe is so flexible it fills as if there were no shoes on their feet. The shoe is so lightweight its 1.5 weight makes it fill as if you could run forever. I also think the prices for the Nike air max cost so much money is because of how comfortable the shoe is to the users.The shoe immediately out of the box looked cheap and seemed poorly made. The style of the shoe looks like it's not made to least still it's one of the best of its kind. People all over the world buys the Nike air max 2013 for running and running only it's understandable why, the shoe is great for running but the shoe is way too ugly to cost over $200. I think people would buy this shoe just cause of the ethos super stars put on about the shoe, cause to me the shoe is not all that great but like I said the shoe do have good quality use for athletes of all kind.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "What's so good about them!", "unixReviewTime": 1359936000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2013"}

Something about walking on a bubble of air always fascinated me. But this year I think Nike missed the mark. The most obvious change is to the tongue of the shoe. Or whatever this thing is called. It's extremely thin made of some type of nylon. Reminds me of the same material rain jackets are made of. It's so thin I have doubts it will last very long. Its like a flap of fabric, no cushion to it at all. The tongue is so thin and small that I have a hard time grabbing the thing when pulling them on me feet.  I typically buy new Nike once a year. But the feel of these shoes does not instill confidence in me that they will make the entire year. Maybe it's just me. But I feel prior versions were made of better material. I will keep them simply because I need new shoes. But if I had seen these in the store before I made my purchase online, I probably would have chosen a different year model. Don't get me wrong, they are still Nike Air max. And if you wear Nike as much as I wear Nike,  then they will do just fine.

The thought and designing that went into this product attests to that fact.  First of all, these flip-flops are fantastically comfortable.  The memory foam surface conforms to and supports your foot with unparalleled comfort.  For that, this product deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the soles are durable and slow little sign of wear.  But there's a dark side to these sandals...they don't last.My wife bought a pair of these about 11 months ago and the fabric beneath both of her big toes has already worn through, and the foam is peeling away.  The fabric also wore through along the edges of one of the heels.It's not like she wears these year round...we live in Idaho, so flip-flop weather lasts only half of the year...if you are lucky.  In our experience, if someone were to wear these consistently, they might see unacceptable levels of wear and tear within 6 months.That is simply not acceptable for a sandal that costs $30-40.  I mean, I usually don't spend more than that for shoes!  For that these sandals deserve 1 star.The only course left open in terms of rating this product is give it the average of the pluses and minuses and give it 3 stars.

I found them on sale at Shopko for less than I have seen them anywhere else. That aside, these thongs are the most comfortable I have ever owned. After reading through many of the reviews here, I was concerned that I might not get a good fit since several people complained about them running small. I usually wear an 8, but can sometimes wear a 7 1/2. However, rather than be disappointed in an online purchase, I decided to try them on before buying. I first tried an 8, which was comfortable and fit fairly well. I almost bought those, until I tried the 9. They were even more comfortable and gave me about an inch behind my heal and my toes in the right place. So I ended up buying the 9 and am very happy with them. Very, very comfortable....almost like wearing my most comfy slippers. The worse part was trying to decide what color I wanted....I wanted them all!

Gaspard \"Tina\"", "helpful": [41, 45], "reviewText": "I know the review title is kind of silly and maybe a bit provocative, but, it is just the plain truth! My feet are pretty much never happy. I have very high arches and could never get used to wearing orthotics, so, my feet perpetually crave a massage. When I started running a while back, this became even more of a problem. I bought a pair of shoes that were supposed to have a lot of support and cushioning (since I am a big girl), but they felt like anvils on my feet. I knew I needed a lighter shoe, but in most cases lighter means less cushion and support. For smaller, flat-footed people, those shoes work fine, but not me. I did a lot of research and tried a shoe that was supposed to be a sort of transitional shoe from the standard running shoe to barefoot running and also have a high arch. The shoes felt ok, and were certainly light, but I definitely felt the lack of support, stability and cushion and wound up with sore knees for hours after each run. So, I went back online, did tons more research and then headed to the sporting goods store to try on shoes. From the moment I put these shoes on and felt how they hugged my arches, I was in love. But, they are kind of minimal shoes and I was worried that they would also result in my suffering with sore knees or hips. Instead of buying these \"send my arches to heaven\" shoes, I did more research and compared the cushion, support and stability ratings with other more traditional shoes that were recommended for heavy runners. This shoe held it's own in pretty much every category...and it was a good 2-3 ounces lighter, too! Finally, I felt comfortable buying the shoes my arches fell in love with.I've since run in them several times and spent a day walking in them, too. They are, quite simply, the best shoes my feet have ever been in. I have never gotten that \"anvils for shoes\" feeling, and never had sore knees or hips. In fact, despite their low profile/thin sole, these shoes feel more supportive and cushioned than my other clunkers with a huge sole. I absolutely adore these shoes! But, I would caution anyone considering these shoes to do their homework, go to a local store to try them on and run around a bit in them. Everyone's feet are different and the extra step could save you from the disappointment, pain and hassle I had with my other running shoe purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"No shoe ever touched me this way!\"", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2013"}

After a week or so of use, the shoes began developing a loud squeak.  That is, when walking in these shoes, a loud squeaking noise is generated with every step.  The squeak is not generated by the outer sole and the floor surface (like when walking with wet shoes on a tile floor).  This squeak occurs even when walking on carpeting and appears to emanate from somewhere between the inner and outer layers of the sole in the area under the ball of your foot.  The squeak is prominent enough that not only can you hear it, but you can feel it.  The shoe actually vibrates under the ball of your foot with each step.  This is an extremely aggravating sensation and I find myself loosening the laces and slipping my feet out of them whenever possible.

My biggest complaint is that for the price, the quality is a bit lacking. Long-term durability is yet to be seen, but they lack the feel of a well-made shoe that I have come to expect from Nike. Back in the day, you could still get a quality shoe from Nike without going into the triple-digit price range. These are not the least-expensive pair of Nikes that I could have bought, but they \"feel\" like they are.I am not referring to the fact that they are light weight, which is a plus, but more to the overall appearance and feel. The soles feel very \"plastic-y\", and make more noise than what I am used to, or care for. The rest of the shoe just feels synthetic and cheaply made. If this is what passes for a reasonably priced pair of Nikes today, then I am pretty disappointed. If it is just this model, then I feel a bit deceived.On the plus side, they are reasonably comfortable, and have a good bit of cushion at the bottom of the foot (insole?), hence the third star.

{"reviewerID": "A1JBCHYKA38D9A", "asin": "B0098G7Q1S", "reviewerName": "George A. Macdonald", "helpful": [28, 32], "reviewText": "I was having trouble with shoes and feet for a while. I was wearing dress shoes to work and working in NYC I'm on pavement all the time. I rarely walk on anything other than pavement and handling the NYC subway daily is a lot on your feet. Lots of stairs, lots of concrete. At the end of the day if your feet don't hurt you're doing something right, which I have to thank Nike Free Run for.Before I got these shoes my feet weren't getting enough cushion between my foot and the gravel. I was wearing dress shoes daily and frankly my feet were falling apart. I saw a doctor who told me that my arches had collapsed and I wasn't getting enough support from my dress shoes. I'm 25. He told me to get these hard inserts to put in my shoes. These weren't cushioned inserts, they were hard and stiff. They made the ground feel harder and made me even less comfortable than I had been before. That didn't make a lot of sense to me. Why would I want a nonflexible inserts to fix my flat feet? I tried the soft inserts as well, but obviously those soft inserts aren't re-engineering the shoes. My dress shoes still sucked, and the damage was done. My feet problems extended to my back and suddenly I'm 25 and miserable.Now it's not fair to compare dress shoes and sneakers. Obviously sneakers should be more comfortable and provide more support. But you have to understand, the damage had been done. I moved to sneakers and STILL COULDN'T WALK IN MOST OF THEM. I experimented with a few different sneakers. In converse shoes my foot pain started almost immediately. I tried some cheap sneakers and those were also useless. I also tried an expensive pair of Nike sneakers, and frankly, those didn't work either. Nothing provided support to the inside of my foot, they only created a cushion for the bottom of my feet. I have four or five pairs of sneakers that I wore maybe 5 or 6 times that are sitting in my closet never to be seen again.Enter Nike Free Run 5: These shoes are unlike most shoes and most sneakers because they're TIGHT, but they will eventually expand to fit your feet. They're tight but with lots of flexibility so the foot can do what it wants to do naturally, but the shoe gets right in there on the inside of the foot and lifted the portion of my wide feet that were prone to expanding. Again, my problem is flat feet. My arches were collapsing. This shoe LIFTS my arch and keeps it there. The shoe has those side strings that tighten the shoe around the sides of your feet, it's not just tightening the top of the shoe to the sole of the shoe (which logically will flatten your feet!). You can see the engineering on the shoe itself, the side strings around the sides of the shoe is where it's at. The support isn't coming from the sole, it's coming from all around the shoe. My feet feel much, much better. There were times where my feet hurt so much that I couldn't walk anymore. That doesn't happen to me now. I'm wondering if wearing these sneakers has reversed any of the problems I've had with my arches (since I used to have pretty good arches) but honestly, I have no interest in going back to the doctor even if only out of spite.This doesn't solve my problem with bad dress shoes. Well, actually, it kind of does. At least my feet are healthy enough to put on dress shoes when I absolutely need to. But the rest of the time, it's Nike Free Run 5.I stick with the all black ones most of the time. I bought the bright yellow pair as well, but I haven't brought myself to wear them much. They're just too garish. I'll probably get them in the more subdued red colors next, but these are likely to be the only sneakers wear from now on.

If you have never had this type of shoe I recommend walking around in them for a couple of days and then easing into the running. Your calves will probably hurt for the first couple of times running.The quality of the stitching is great, style is simple and unobtrusive, the build is solid (it does not seem it as these shoes are LIGHT!!), and the best part of all is that all of my aches and pains that used to occur the day after running are gone (minus the muscles, they still hurt). The proof is in the performance. I recently did a challenge of 40 miles in two weeks on Strava. I completed the challenge plus some and I feel fine. With previous Nike running shoes (I am not a running guru so forgive me) my knees would be killing me and shin splints would be present.Don't play sports in these shoes!! They are awesome for running but the support for anything else is nil. I run offroad in these and do alright but I notice the instability a little and slow down.

I have put about 100 miles on them so far, and they seem to be holding up very well, as they should. When it gets below freezing, I usually leave these at home. Not much fabric, so toes get cold. I ordered my normal size. They are snug, but comfortable. Overall a great shoe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Shoe!", "unixReviewTime": 1392595200, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2014"}

Solid, dependable, it's been around forever. It just goes to show that the best running shoe is the shoe that fits YOU best. Recently I splurged on a pair of Nike fly-knits. It gets great reviews and it fit me really nicely at first, but after running more than 4 miles in them my ankle started hurting.  I no doubt believe that those who are giving the fly-knit 5 stars are having a great experience. I have learned, and re-learned, though, that for me, nothing beats the Pegasus. It's not a minimalist shoe but it is so soft and has so much padding that I can run forever in these and never feel the pounding. Yes the fly-knit is light as a feather, but I will trade off a little extra weight for a shoe that I can feel and that gives my feet the protection they need. The Nike Vomero is a similar shoe and I recently trained and ran a 1/2 marathon in the Vomero without issues. However, the Pegasus is even more comfortable than the Vomero for me and it is less expensive. I caught a great deal on amazon and got these for $83.49!  I have never been disappointed in the Nike Pegasus- why I waste my money trying the latest craze in running shoe's I don't know. It will be Pegasus forever from now on. I don't know if it's because my meet are a little flat, but I find myself buying the Pegasus and Vomero's a full size and a half larger than my normal shoes and they are very comfortable for me.

I am an extreme supinator who prefers a neutral shoe with lots of cushioning throughout. I can't wear any shoe with a dual density sole or motion control. I can tell in short order if I'm wearing the wrong shoe, as my arches will flare up during a walk/run. Generally, with Nike, one must buy a half size larger; this has been my experience, anyway. The Pegasus 30 is true to my normal size (11). The full-length Cushlon is top-shelf and it provides plush cushioning throughout the stride. The upper is breathable and seamless, so there are no painful spots on the top of the foot (or anywhere else). The shoe provides a snug and supportive fit and is light in weight. There is plenty of room in the toe box area, so no pinching. The sole provides excellent grip and contact with paved surfaces. Although I haven't run in wet conditions in this shoe, I am certain that the traction would be excellent. Now, I will provide a short list of other shoes that I have worn/run in for extended periods that I feel the Pegasus is superior to: Asics Kayano 19, Asics Nimbus 14, Brooks Ghost 5, New Balance 990. Of course this is based on my subjectivity, but the Pegasus feels lighter and provides more plush cushioning than any of these shoes. I will also mention that this is my first pair of Pegasus. If Nike continues to be consistent with future designs on this shoe, I can't see myself wearing anything else.

I generally like Nike shoes because they fit my feet well but they frustrate me at times because the ones I like (e.g Vomero 5) are sometimes replaced by successors that are quite a bit different, functionality-wise, but that is an old story.A quick note on the sizing of these: I tried Hokas and loved the cushion but they are just too narrow for my feet. I had to give them up. I tried Vomero 9s, and those too were too tight so I went to Vomero 9 wides, and those fit very well. The regular width 30+ Pegasus fits me fine, not too narrow. I'm just trying to share a couple examples in case you have tried similar shoes. Speaking of the Vomero 9s I would recommend them about the same as these, with the exception of needing a wider model.

Wright \"Reader, Writer, Reviewer\"", "helpful": [25, 25], "reviewText": "As an underpronator, I'm generally told to look for a running shoe that is cushioned, flexible, and has arch support but no stability features. The cushion is to offset the fact that my foot is rather rigid (which is why it doesn't roll in to the neutral position). I need impact to be absorbed, so I don't hurt myself. The flexibility is to encourage my foot to roll inward in much as it is willing to do so. And the arch support reduces the affect of impact on my arch, and as a result helps me avoid plantar fasciitis (which I have suffered from in the past).This shoe meets all the above criteria. Despite being incredibly well cushioned, it somehow also manages to be flexible in the forefoot. The middle section of the shoe wraps my foot snugly, lending arch support. I feel both secure and comfortable in this shoe. Also, this shoe is lighter than some other cushioned shoes I've tried. In short, I love it!Sizing note: My non-running shoes are all 8-8.5. My running shoes are generally size 9.

It's got nothing to do with the pretty colors (though there ARE several combinations to choose from), but moreso with the fact that I was overwhelmingly satisfied with the shoes I was already running in (La Sportiva Helios women's), and, thinking I would never need to switch, almost didn't even give the famed Pegasus a second glance.(Cue a gift certificate to the local Running Room and enter pretty colors...)I at first hesitated to buy any shoe heavier than my Helios', however when informed that 80% of injury reported to my local store were from wearing the Nike Frees, I quickly repented.I had read reviews of the Pegasus 30's and saw they fit small and to go a half size up.  I tried my typical size (8) and then 8.5 and the reviews were spot-on.I took them home, blasted out a quick 2 miles on the treadmill and immediately called the store to inform them of my immense satisfaction with these beautiful shoes.  For one, the ride is smooth and the heels have GREAT cushion without compromising overall shoe weight.  I've been healing up a bad heel which usually becomes sore after any amount of running at all, but not this time!Over the weekend I took them out again - this time on a mix of road and trail.  After about 4 miles on the road and about 6 on trail, I decided that I still hadn't had enough so I spent my last 2 miles sprinting up and down hills near my house.

The flyknit free have a more flexible sole but not quite the cushion of the lunars. The frees have a great compression upper that you can wear sockless but the compression fit can constrict over time.I usually wear a 12 in running shoes. My lunars are perfect in that size. The frees are a different beast. As I said the upper is a compression one and hugs your foot tightly. You don't actually need the laces on these it works so well. Issue is that over time it begins to hurt the top of your feet and a bit around the ankle. In my 12's I have given up wearing them with socks as they are just to tight. Barefoot is fine and in line with what they were designed for. I have a second pair in 13's now which is a first for me. They fit much better although they still feel a bit tight after a few hours. My wife has a pair of the frees as well in the womens model. She is a 9 and I got her a 9.5. She loves them but can't wear them all day due to the compression hurting the top of her foot. I probably could have gone to a 10 for her.Style, color, feel are awesome. One of the few shoes I can wear barefoot, although I generally perfer socks which is why I up sized.

Pierce \"rock and/or roller\"", "helpful": [9, 11], "reviewText": "Quick note: the shoes come out of the box a little curved at the toe, like an impotent shoe ready to be broken in, and they kind of remain that way after several runs.  The image above makes the shoe look odd.  This has no effect on my review, or their performance, however.On to the shoe.  I've always like nike free, but went through a falling out with running for a while.  after picking it back up by transition into Barefoot running, Vibrams, then NB Minimus, I bought frees.  Loved 'em, but didn't like how the shoe was shaped like either foot (curving left or right at the toe box).  I got an email from Nike showing the release of the Flyknits, and absolutely had to have them.They took a week or so to get used to: wearing w/o sox is the preferred style, and this allows the elastic opening to chafe the front of my leg, right above the top of the foot.  It went away, and running was never the same.- Shoes are super light and responsive.  I don't HATE thicker more cushioned shoes, but I don't wear them.  I like a more natural feel, and these deliver.  The 7-4mm drop is just the amount of cushioning I could want, and the outsoles are soft and super flexy.- the flyknit material keeps the shoe tight and on your foot, even w/o sox.  No friction, no moving, great ventilation.  Somewhat constrictive, but it feels great.  also keeps a nice, curved shoe that doesn't force your foot in a flat or straight position, and doesn't fight against pronation.- can run with or w/o laces.  I keep em just to maintain that shoe look, rather than skittles colored house slippers, but I haven't adjusted them in months.- if you like minimal, or rather, running on the front of your foot, these may not be the best for you.  they help maintain a good forward/midfoot strike, which I like (and if i wanna switch it up i thrown on my NB minimus road).  the soles are rather wide and long, so there's much more contact, but they're sectioned, allowing more surface area, thus more responsiveness around the whole foot.- not ideal for racing, as the bottoms are a little slick, at least for a track or hardwood surface (my school's gym), but they're great for asphalt and gravel (no annoying rocks stabbing the bottom of your feet).- colors: awesome.  something about the &#34;heat map pattern&#34; that supposed to articulate your foot's pressure/contact points, but I'm not sure about that.  either way, they look super!- price: way too much. I was a bit impulsive by getting these; I was walking by the nike lab in la outside the x-games and had to have em.  but they've proven to be a great investment.  I would do it again.  shoes are hearty, soles are tuff, colors are way out there, lightweight, fast, responsive.  just way groovy shoes.  even good in the rain, despite the lack of traction material.I'm not one to go nuts about reducing shoes and running down to the science, cause it gets us nowhere.  I just happen to find a great pair of shoes at a not-so-great price.  i don't buy into the scientific jargon and rules for running regarding pronation and forefoot/midfoot/barefoot/upsidedown foot blah blah.  I'm 30, and have been running religiously since I joined the Army Infantry in '02, which put my feet through hell, and I've never had a running problem, except when I stopped for a year and picked up smoking.  If you're looking for a new way to run, try these out.  get away from what the fleet feet- ers and the action runners and whomever tell you.  the greatest runners run the way they feel best, not how others tell them to.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Change the Main Image", "unixReviewTime": 1387152000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2013"}

I prefer to run on grass mainly and will run on the treadmill a couple of times a week. I have a normal arch and a slight pronation of my left foot. I have had these shoes for over a month now and have logged some miles on them.  The first thing I noticed apart from them looking pretty cool was that there is a support band made out of some sort of plastic glue that holds the upper in place toward the front of the shoe where the laces start. I felt the tightness noticeably when I first put them on and it initially gave me some concern because I do have a wide foot. However that turned out to be a non issue. I still feel it and others who have the shoe express similar sentiments. It does not affect my running in any way and after I've been in the shoes for a bit I don't notice it at allI switched to these shoes after using a much more expensive shoe the Asics gel kinsea. I quit using them after I developed plantar fasciitis. I was seriously disappointed in those shoes. The nike free has been free of pain for me!

I am a sixty-two year old woman who walks 5-7 miles daily, sometimes a little more and occasionally a little less (if my feet are aching). I tend to get a few more aches and pains than when I was younger and sometimes I get aches and pains in my feet, probably because I walk so much. I have had a few broken bones in my feet and wrists, but no really severe broken bones, so I am not sure if that is a contributing factor, or just that I am getting older and walk so much. Some mornings I do wake up with stiffness in my hands, so I may have some minor arthritis due to having had broken bones in the past. I had been wearing the Merrell Moab shoes, which worked well for a while, though they were heavy. Then, I got a knot on the bottom of my foot in the arch area and also a pain on the top of my foot down the left side. I decided to go back to a lighter pair of shoes. In the past I had worn some very lightweight Merrell running shoes which were very comfortable, but I did tend to get a callous area on the outer edge of one of my feet  on the side where my little toe is. I went to Dick's and saw the Nike Flyknit 4.0 shoes and tried them on and instantly loved them. The knit material on the top of the shoe hugs and conforms to your foot giving support but is not at all constrictive. Nowhere does the shoe rub against the skin so it is a shoe that is not blister causing. The bottom of the shoe is very flexible and bends with your foot but also has very good arch support, or does for my foot anyway. I bought the pair at Dick's and paid $20.00 more for them than these shoes cost. They relieved my foot pain instantly when I started wearing them. After walking about 20 miles in the pair I got from Dick's Sporting Goods, I ordered these from Amazon.com and saved myself $20.00. I figured it would be good to have two pairs. They are so lightweight. It is amazing how much more energy that I have since switching back to a light-weight pair of shoes. I think my foot really benefits from the more flexible sole and my balance also feels better with the lower heel of the shoe. I find that as I am getting older my balance is not as good as my younger years and a lower heeled shoe makes me feel more stable with a better center of balance. So far, these shoes are working great for me. Hope they continue to work well. Will need to look for a warmer version for winter wear though, because the knit material I do not think will be warm enough for winter wear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "fantastic so far, helped relieve foot pain", "unixReviewTime": 1400112000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014"}

The gym is a good place, as is cross fit.After my brief love affair with the original Free Flyknit in Rainbow Vomit color scheme, I decided to give the newer, lighter iteration a go.  I used the Free Flyknit 5.0 for a good 6 months, averaging about 4 miles with maximums of 6, at a good pace too (~ 6:45/mile); then I realized that anything further and the shoes began to hold me back, like I was running through mud.I gave these a shot, though, as I wanted a new distance shoe and figured maybe it was just the weirdness of the inaugural shoe.  It wasn't, for me at least.  The same issue persists, even with a revamped sole and upper.  And I think the former is the problem.  i've never felt truly &#34;fast&#34; in any of the frees; maybe the very first ones back in 2003, but I was in the Army then and running a lot against my will.The sole is not a single mass; it's several pods or hexagons that are fused to the insole and allow the shoe to flex with nearly every subtle movement of the foot.  Nike WANTS this to translate to a more natural feel, and yet I think it over exaggerates it.  Whereas some shoes of the same minimalist vain succeed in this area by keeping the sole one whole piece, Nike went a bit too far.  II think what's happening is the sole is allowing impact energy to spread across each individual pod, and when there's more surface area I feel like the shoe begins to work against the runner.  Basically, the pods are too independent and cushy to allow for an optimal strike and return - anything more than 3 miles and I start to feel like I'm running through mud.  This could be such a good shoe if the sole were more, substantial: maybe a bit thinner but stiffer.  The upper is fantastic though.  So, I don't recommend this shoe for anyone who wants to work on speed or distance.
